Contributing Frequently Asked Questions This FAQ compiles questions that relate to Jam in particular. For things related to JoinMarket in general, please refer to the JoinMarket documentation . How much can I earn? Earning sats entails providing liquidity to other market participants. Consequently, how much you can earn depends on multiple factors, market conditions and liquidity size being two of them. In general, the more liquidity you provide, the more you can earn. That being said, you are competing in an open market, and because competition is global and only constraint by market forces, the margin is usually thin. If your offers are not taken by market participants, your offer might be too expensive. Check the order book and compare your offer to the market price. If your offer is competitive and is still ignored, make sure to create a Fidelity Bond , which signals that you are a serious market participant and not a malicious entity. See also \" a few words about incentives \" from the JoinMarket documentation. How high are the fees that I do have to pay? The amount of fees you have to pay depends on market and blockspace conditions. They are dictated by supply and demand, both for collaborative transactions and single user transactions. Market makers provide liquidity and set the fee they want to earn, either in absolute or percentage terms. Market takers have to agree to take these offers voluntarily. Check the orderbook to get an up-to-date overview of the current fee market. In addition to these fees, you will have to pay mining fees for you and the makers. Mining fees depend on how many transactions are currently in the mempool . Inspect your mempool or use a public site like mempool.space to do a fee estimation. Hint We recommended that you run your own mempool.space instance on your full node. See also \" a note on fees \" from the JoinMarket documentation. I'm getting an error when trying to open the wallet The following error can pop up in case JoinMarket didnt't shut down cleanly: wallet.jmdat cannot be created/opened, it is locked. Warning Make sure that you have written down your wallet seed before executing any command You can resolve this by manually deleting the wallet .lock file as explained in issue #173 . Why is my collaborative transaction taking so long? This can have multiple reasons. Tor or general network connection issues, participants not responding in a timely manner, missing requirements to source commitments ( see the docs ), period of slow block production, unexpected increase of transaction fees, etc. For a better assessment, the following can be taken as a guideline: single collaborative transactions generally take only a few minutes (<15min) a scheduled sweep can take hours, even days (<3days) If an operation takes longer than that, then there might be a different issue. See \"Something else is/seems stuck\" for more info. Something else is/seems stuck; what can I do? If a single collaborative transaction takes hours, or if your scheduled sweep already takes over three days, there might be a different underlying problem. A general rule of thumb is: Any operation either succeeds or fails. If an operation is aborted prematurely, there is no danger of loss of funds. All operations can be aborted by locking your wallet . Since Jam does not yet have a way to provide fine grained error information to users, it is always a good idea to inspect the log files for warning and error messages. How do I view the log file? If you are running Jam with one of the supported integrations (RaspiBlitz, Citadel, Umbrel, etc.) chances are you can view the logs inside the app (See Settings > Show logs). If the option is not displayed, or if you run the standalone docker image yourself, you can find all log files inside the container in directory /var/log/jam/ . See jmwalletd_stdout.log or jmwalletd_stderr.log for problems with Jam. e.g. tail -n 200 -f /var/log/jam/jmwalletd_stdout.log If you run JoinMarket natively, you can find the logs files inside the logs folder of JoinMarket's working directory (e.g. /home/<user>/.joinmarket/logs ) e.g. tail -n 200 -f /home/user/.joinmarket/logs/jmwalletd_logs.log How to resolve \"No connection to gateway\"? This can have several reasons and basically means that the UI cannot reach the backend service. Depending on your installation (native setup, docker images, local/remote hosts, etc.), there are a number of things you should verify. Please make sure that: Your Bitcoin Core instance is up and running, fully synced and is accepting RPC requests. bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo The backend service is running and is reachable on the specified ports. Verify that you get a response from the server, by executing a request on the host that is running your JoinMarket instance (if you run an Umbrel node, this requests needs to be executed inside the Jam docker container): curl --insecure https://127.0.0.1:28183/api/v1/session Check the logs for any errors or warnings. If all the above fails, try restarting every service or do a complete node reboot. As a last resort, seek help in the support channel . Can I import an existing wallet? Yes, it is possible to import an existing wallet. However, not yet via the web interface, but with a few manual steps via the command line. Log into the host machine, e.g. with ssh (see an example for Umbrel below) Navigate to JoinMarket's root directory Invoke the recover mechansim of the wallet-tool.py script . jmvenv/bin/activate # if virtual environment is enabled python3 scripts/wallet-tool.py recover --gap-limit=200 --recoversync Answer questions (provide seed phrase, etc.).

About Jam Jam is a free and open-source project that aims to improve the financial privacy of yourself and others, without relying on a trusted third party. It was started in 2021 by various volunteers and is still developed and maintained on a volunteer basis. As mentioned above, Jam is a front-end for JoinMarket, a privacy-focused bitcoin software that uses a peer-to-peer marketplace to facilitate collaborative transactions. The goal of Jam is to provide an interface that makes JoinMarket easier to use, and thus more easily accessible for more people. About JoinMarket JoinMarket is a special kind of software that is aimed at improving the privacy and fungibility of bitcoin transactions. The main way to improve privacy and fungibility on-chain is via collaborative transactions. A collaborative transaction requires the coordination of multiple parties. The right resources ( UTXOs ) have to be available in the right quantity at the right time. Consequently, the problem that needs to be solved is not a technological problem, but an economic problem. JoinMarket solves this problem not by central coordination, but by creating a market that allows participants to allocate these resources in the best way, according to their individual needs. About the Name The name \"Jam\" is a backronym, stands for JoinMarket's Awesome, Man , and shouldn't be taken too seriously. However, it works on multiple levels ( Let's jam the signal! ) and \"cooking jam\" is also a fun metaphor for mixing something in a tasty way (and putting it in jars ).

This glossary explains some of the concepts and terms used in Jam. [ A \u00b7 B \u00b7 C \u00b7 D \u00b7 E \u00b7 F \u00b7 G \u00b7 H \u00b7 I \u00b7 J \u00b7 K \u00b7 L \u00b7 M \u00b7 N \u00b7 O \u00b7 P \u00b7 Q \u00b7 R \u00b7 S \u00b7 T \u00b7 U \u00b7 V \u00b7 W \u00b7 X \u00b7 Y \u00b7 Z ] A Address A bitcoin address\u2014also called bitcoin invoice address 1 \u2014is a string of characters that you send to someone else to receive funds. There are currently three invoice address formats in use: P2PKH starting with 1 P2SH starting with 3 Bech32 starting with bc1 For more details please refer to the Bitcoin Wiki . Jam defaults to Bech32 addresses. Address Reuse Address reuse refers to the practice of reusing a single bitcoin invoice address for multiple transactions. It is highly discouraged since it harms the privacy of yourself and others. You should never reuse addresses. Bitcoin Wiki: Address Reuse Anonymity Set The only way to hide in plain sight is by hiding in a crowd. The anonymity set is simply the size of this crowd. If you are putting on a hat and sunglasses to hide in a crowd of people that are wearing the same hat and sunglasses, your anonymity set is the size of this crowd. If said crowd is 50 people, an attacker could mistake you for anyone out of these 50 people. Similarly, when doing a collaborative transaction in bitcoin, you are creating an onchain footprint that is equivalent to the onchain footprint of others. B Base Layer Bitcoin's base layer (or Layer 1 ) refers to any transaction that touches the timechain , i.e. all onchain transactions. The base layer is concerned with global consensus and settlement. Higher layers build ontop the settlement assurrances of the base layer. One example of a Layer 2 system is the Lightning Network. All money is layered, including gold and fiat monies. Read Layered Money by Nik Bhatia to understand this in more detail. Layered Money Batch Transaction A batch transaction is a transaction that combines multiple real-world transactions into one on-chain transaction. It has multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Different parties may control one or multiple inputs and receive one or multiple outputs. Privacy Fundamentals Bech32 Bech32 is an invoice address format. It was specified in BIP 173 and is used for both SegWit and Taproot addresses. Blockchain A mostly meaningless marketing term used to confuse newcomers. While \" block chain \" is still the main term used to refer to Bitcoin's linked data structure of blocks, it has increasingly become meaningless over the years as it got co-opted by grifters, charlatans & marketers. A better, more descriptive term of said data structure is timechain . C Chain Analysis Chain analysis is is the practice of applying heuristics to a timechain 's public transaction graph. The goal of chain analysis is to link the pseudonymous identities created by bitcoin software with \"real\" identities corresponding to natural persons or entities. Chain analysis is based on flawed assumptions, because ownership in bitcoin is defined by secret knowledge, not possession. Identities can only be linked probabilistically, not provably. One of the main assumptions used by chain analysis companies is the common input ownership heuristic . Collaborative transactions break this heuristic. CoinJoin A CoinJoin is a collaborative transaction that combines inputs from multiple parties. The purpose of a CoinJoin is to combine inputs and create outputs in ways that improves the financial privacy of participants, without relying on a trusted third party for custody. When done correctly, a CoinJoin breaks any deterministic links between transactions, moving the process of chain analysis from quasi-deterministic with high certainty to probabilistic with low certainty. CoinJoins break the common input ownership heuristic that is used by chain analysis companies to de-anonymize actors. The concept was introduced in 2013 by Gregory Maxwell. 2 3 All CoinJoin transactions are collaborative transactions. The two main types of CoinJoin transactions are equal-output and unequal-output CoinJoins. Other differences might be interactivity (or lack thereof) and number of participants. Collaborative Transaction A collaborative transaction is a bitcoin transaction that is initiated and signed by multiple participants. A collaborative transaction involves two or more parties and is thus always a batch transaction . All CoinJoins are collaborative transactions. Change When using physical cash, spending a $100 bill to pay for a $25 item, you will get $75 back in change. The reason for this is that you can't spend just a part of the bill, because ripping off a quarter of it for payment will invalidate the bill. Consequently, when bills change hands, the whole bill has to be spent, and an appropriate amount of change goes back to the spender. Bitcoin works the same way. When sats change hands, the spender has to spend the whole UTXO . Bitcoin creates the appropriate amount of change automatically. Because all transactions are recorded transparently and publicly on the timechain , As of this writing, 4 a simple spend is the most common transaction type, which describes the example given above: one input ($100 bill) produces two outputs: $25 for the merchant, and $75 in change. The act of an outside observer guessing whether you bought something for $25 or $75 (or: who was the customer of the transaction, and who was the merchant) is what is called change detection . Change Detection When it comes to chain analysis , change detection is the name of the game. The goal of chain analysis companies is to link identities to transactions, and to do that, one has to detect whether funds changed hands or not. Technically speaking, change detection is trying to figure out which output of a transaction is a change output. Change detection is based on various heuristics. False positives will always exist, even if the transaction under scrutiny is a simple spend . Consequently, it is more an art than a science. To quote one special investigations team speaking on chain analysis: Attributing ownership, however, is often nuanced because outside observers can only infer it depending on factors such as availability and quality of the evidence. Evidence means proof that indeed an address belongs to an individual or entity. Unless you own an address yourself, it is very difficult to say with absolute certainty who an address is owned by. This is why it\u2019s more fitting to consider blockchain analytics more of an art than science. CSIT Keep in mind that ownership can change without any on-chain transaction happening, e.g. by passing on a private key directly. It is also possible that amount to be paid lines up perfectly with a single UTXO, meaning that what looks like a self-spend is actually a payment. One can only conclude, as is also mentioned in the report linked above, that \"an external observer cannot possibly gain a full picture or claim 100% confidence in ownership attribution.\" Privacy Fundamentals: The Bitcoin Transaction Bitcoin Wiki: Change Detection CIOH Short for Common Input Ownership Heuristic . Common Input Ownership Heuristic The common input ownership heuristic assumes that all inputs of a transaction are controlled by a single entity. This assumption is clearly wrong, because collaborative transactions exist. CoinJoin transactions are designed to break this heuristic. D Doxxic Change \"Doxxic\" change is any leftover change that is going back to you when participating in an equal-output CoinJoin . Doxxic change is problematic because it can potentially destroy any privacy benefits gained from a CoinJoin.

E Eclipse Attack An eclipse attack is an attack in networked systems in which an attacker targets a node to convince it of a false network state. The attacker surrounds the node in order to conceal or block off accurate information, leaving the attacked node(s) in the dark in terms of the global network state. An eclipse attack is similar to a Sybil attack . Bitcoin Stack Exchange: Eclipse Attack vs. Sybil Attack Equal-Output CoinJoin An equal-output CoinJoin is a collaborative transaction that produces outputs of equal denomination, i.e. outputs of equal value when measured in sats. For this reason, these types of transactions are also referred to as equal-amount or equal-value CoinJoin transactions. Equal-output CoinJoins are batch transaction that are easily identifiable on-chain due to their uniform output structure. Like any collaborative transaction, an equal-output CoinJoin breaks the Common Input Ownership Heuristic . Participating in such a transaction allows you to gain privacy by \"hiding in the crowd.\" Jam defaults to collaborative transactions when sending and sweeping , creating equal-output CoinJoins. F Fidelity Bond A fidelity bond is an insurance policies which protects the policyholder from wrongful acts committed by others. The term comes from the world of business and finance, thus the policyholders are usually companies, and the other parties are usually employees. In JoinMarket, a fidelity bond is a mechanism which ensures that market actors act honestly. It is a protection mechanism against Sybil attacks , because a fidelity bond makes the creation of cryptographic identities costly. Warning It is impossible to move or spend funds that are locked in a fidelity bond before the bond expires. They cannot be used in collaborative transactions as fidelity bonds are time-locked by the Bitcoin protocol. Fidelity bonds improve the privacy guarantees of the whole system and increase your chance of being chosen as a market maker drastically. What Are Fidelity Bonds and How Do They Work in JoinMarket?

Spaceballs About jamapp.org Jar In Jam, a \"jar\" is a container that holds some sats of yours. 6 Jars exist to segregate your sats into multiple buckets that are disconnected from each other, which aids privacy. To not risk any privacy degradation, you can only spend from one jar at a time. There are 5 jars by default. The default jar to receive funds is Jar A . M Maker A market maker is someone who offers bitcoin liquidity to the market, to be used by others for collaborative transactions. You can create an offer via the \"Earn\" tab and become a market maker. Earn Screen The Maker Role Mempool Short for 'memory pool.' A pool of valid bitcoin transactions held by each node, that are not yet confirmed in the timechain . Mempool O Offchain An offchain (or off-chain) transaction is any transaction that does not happen onchain . Examples include transactions on the Lightning network, the handing over of physical private keys, as well as transactions on centralized ledgers such as exchanges and other trusted third parties. Some offchain transactions, such as handing over private keys on USB sticks or similar, are outside of the scope of chain analysis . Consequently, chain analysis can never be completely accurate. Onchain An onchain (or on-chain) transaction is a bitcoin transaction that is settled on the bitcoin timechain . The analysis of these transactions is called chain analysis , which is the spying on and de-anonymizing of bitcoin's users by trying to find patterns in the onchain data.

Learn Me A Bitcoin: P2SH PayJoin A PayJoin is a collaborative transaction between two parties that facilitates an actual payment for a good or service. The merchant agrees to provide one or multiple inputs to the transaction, increasing the privacy of both parties. A PayJoin has different onchain characteristics than an equal-output CoinJoin and is not detectable via chain analysis alone. A PayJoin transaction has multiple interpretations, all of which are equally valid. In addition to breaking the common input ownership heuristic it poisons the basis of all chain analysis , because of its undetectability. Bitcoin Wiki: PayJoin Bitcoin Wiki: PayJoin Adoption S Sats Short for satoshis , plural of sat (satoshi). A sat the smallest fraction of a bitcoin that can be expressed on-chain . There are 100,000,000 sats in a bitcoin. There are multiple currency symbols for a sat emerging. In Jam, the sat symbol 7 is used: Scheduler The 'scheduler' is a component of JoinMarket which schedules multiple collaborative transactions in a row. It will use random intervals and amounts to make timing analysis and de-anonymization via chain analysis more difficult. The ' Sweep ' screen uses the scheduler to sweep funds to one or multiple external wallets under your control. Simple Spend A transaction that splits one input into two outputs: payment and change. The \"simple spend\" is the most common bitcoin transaction type to date, since most wallet implementations do not optimize for privacy. For most simple spend transactions it is possible to discern which output is the actual payment or which one is the change. This change detection makes the tracing of funds possible. Privacy Fundamentals: The Bitcoin Transaction SNICKER Simple Non-Interactive Coinjoin with Keys for Encryption Reused. SNICKER blog post Sybil Attack A Sybil attack is a special kind of attack in peer-to-peer networked computing. The victim is surrounded by malicious entities, each of which act as if they are a separate entity. The victim believes that everything is in order, that he is getting an accurate state of the network from multiple independent peers. In actuality, the Sybil attacker controls all entities surrounding the victim. Consequently, the attacker is able to trick the victim into accepting a malicious network state. JoinMarket uses fidelity bonds to protect users from Sybil attacks. Design for Improving JoinMarket's Resistance to Sybil Attacks Using Fidelity Bonds Wikipedia: Sybil Attack Sweep A 'sweep' send will transfer all funds of a jar or all funds of your wallet. To sweep all funds from your wallet multiple transactions are created using the scheduler . 'Sweep' Screen T Taint Taint is an external property defined by chain analysis surveillance firms. It is an attempt to trace the origin and ownership of UTXOs , classifying their owners and building lists of \"good\" and \"bad\" money. All taint in bitcoin always is and always will be arbitrarily defined and probabilistically applied. Just like change detection , it is more an art than a science. It can never be done exactly. False positives and false negatives will always arise. The bitcoin network is indifferent to taint. Miners will include any transaction in a valid block that will reward them economically. Any application of taint on the block production level is equivalent to imposing additional rules via a soft-fork, which fully validating nodes can reject. Taker A market taker is someone who buys bitcoin liquidity from the market, taking up market makers on their offers. You can see active offers in the order book . You will automatically take offers when running the scheduler via the \"Sweep\" functionality. Sweep Earn Screen The Taker Role Timechain The data structure of Bitcoin's base layer . It represents a timestamped and linked list of blocks. Anyone can create a new block, but each block must have sufficient proof of work, making it costly to create new blocks. Bitcoin is Time Timelock A UTXO can be locked up by a script which defines that said UTXO can only be spent in a block that is higher than a certain value. This makes UTXOs unspendable before a specific time. Transaction A bitcoin transaction describes the movement of sats . It is structured data that describes inputs and outputs, among other things. A valid bitcoin transaction has at least one input and at least one output. Every transaction input refers to the output of a previous transaction. We say that an input \"consumes\" an output. If an output is not consumed yet, we speak of an unspent transaction output, or UTXO , for short. Privacy Fundamentals: The Bitcoin Transaction Bitcoin Wiki: Transaction Learn Me a Bitcoin: Transactions TX Short for transaction . U Unspent Transaction Output The tip of the chain of signatures which originates in a coinbase output. It's a \"coin\" that has not yet been spent and can still be spend.

The reason for this is that you can't spend just a part of the bill, because ripping off a quarter of it for payment will invalidate the bill. Consequently, when bills change hands, the whole bill has to be spent, and an appropriate amount of change goes back to the spender. Bitcoin works the same way. When sats change hands, the spender has to spend the whole UTXO . Bitcoin creates the appropriate amount of change automatically. Because all transactions are recorded transparently and publicly on the timechain , As of this writing, 4 a simple spend is the most common transaction type, which describes the example given above: one input ($100 bill) produces two outputs: $25 for the merchant, and $75 in change. The act of an outside observer guessing whether you bought something for $25 or $75 (or: who was the customer of the transaction, and who was the merchant) is what is called change detection .","title":"Change"},{"location":"glossary/#change-detection","text":"When it comes to chain analysis , change detection is the name of the game. The goal of chain analysis companies is to link identities to transactions, and to do that, one has to detect whether funds changed hands or not. Technically speaking, change detection is trying to figure out which output of a transaction is a change output. Change detection is based on various heuristics. False positives will always exist, even if the transaction under scrutiny is a simple spend . Consequently, it is more an art than a science. To quote one special investigations team speaking on chain analysis: Attributing ownership, however, is often nuanced because outside observers can only infer it depending on factors such as availability and quality of the evidence. Evidence means proof that indeed an address belongs to an individual or entity. Unless you own an address yourself, it is very difficult to say with absolute certainty who an address is owned by. This is why it\u2019s more fitting to consider blockchain analytics more of an art than science. CSIT Keep in mind that ownership can change without any on-chain transaction happening, e.g. by passing on a private key directly. It is also possible that amount to be paid lines up perfectly with a single UTXO, meaning that what looks like a self-spend is actually a payment.

A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selec\u00adtively reveal oneself to the world.\" Eric Hughes With these powerful words Eric Hughes opened his Cypher\u00adpunk's Manifesto in 1993. The differ\u00adence between privacy and secrecy is subtle, but impor\u00adtant. Choosing to remain private does not imply that one has secrets or has something to hide. To illus\u00adtrate this just realize that what you do on the toilet or in the bedroom is neither illegal nor a secret (in most cases), yet you close the door and pull the curtains. Similarly, how much money you have and where you spend it is not neces\u00adsarily a secret matter. It should, however, be a private one. Most would agree that your boss should not know how you choose to spend your salary. The impor\u00adtance of privacy is recog\u00adnized by many inter\u00adna\u00adtional bodies. From the American Decla\u00adra\u00adtion of the Rights and Duties of Man to the United Nations, it is recog\u00adnized that privacy is a funda\u00admental human right worldwide. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary inter\u00adfer\u00adence with his privacy, family, home or corre\u00adspon\u00addence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputa\u00adtion.

Consequently, any financial liberation that is enabled by Bitcoin rests on the four essential freedoms granted by free software. What is Free Software? \u201cFree software\u201d means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, \u201cfree software\u201d is a matter of liberty, not price.

Free software is not only about being \"open\" and \"more secure.\" While these are nice side-effects, the main issue is about control and respecting user's freedoms. Why Free Software Is Even More Important Now Freedom means having control over your own life. If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program. You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life. Most software and software products force the user into a master-slave relationship, as do most monetary systems and financial products.

Consequently, any financial liberation that is enabled by Bitcoin rests on the four essential freedoms granted by free software. What is Free Software? \u201cFree software\u201d means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, \u201cfree software\u201d is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of \u201cfree\u201d as in \u201cfree speech,\u201d not as in \u201cfree beer.\u201d Free software puts the users in control, both collectively and individually. Free software is not only about being \"open\" and \"more secure.\" While these are nice side-effects, the main issue is about control and respecting user's freedoms. Why Free Software Is Even More Important Now Freedom means having control over your own life. If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program. You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life. Most software and software products force the user into a master-slave relationship, as do most monetary systems and financial products. Bitcoin is freedom money because the software that makes Bitcoin possible is free software\u2014free as in freedom. There are no masters, only peers.

Bitcoin is a new thing, and, consequently, all metaphors and comparisons fall short, in one way or another. One misconception is that Bitcoin is private and untraceable. In actuality, regular Bitcoin use often has weaker privacy guarantees than using the traditional banking system, as Gregory Maxwell pointed out many years ago: \u201cYour inlaws can see that you're buying birth control that deprives them of grandchildren, your employer learns about the non-profits you support with money from your paycheck, and thieves see your latest purchases and how wealthy you are which helps them target and scam you. Poor privacy in Bitcoin can be a major practical disadvantage for both individuals and businesses.\u201d To understand why this is, we have to understand how Bitcoin operates. This, however, turns out to be very difficult. To understand one part, one needs to have a solid understanding of computer science and cryptography. To understand another part, one needs to have a solid understanding of economics and game theory\u2014not to mention money, networks, governance, energy and energy markets, monetary history, and so on. The list of relevant disciplines is almost endless. However, it is possible to look at some parts of Bitcoin in isolation and\u2014hopefully\u2014gain a better understanding by zooming in. One such part is the Bitcoin transaction. The Bitcoin Transaction In the simplest sense, a Bitcoin transaction is just a bunch of data that describes the movement of bitcoins. A bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs. Every transaction input refers to the output of a previous transaction. We say that an input \"consumes\" an output. If an output is not consumed yet, we speak of an unspent transaction output, or UTXO, for short. Once properly understood, it is easy to see what the Bitcoin network generates: a linked data structure that, starting from a common root\u2014the genesis block\u2014splits and combines bundles of sats as time goes on. Properly visualized, it would look a bit like an upside-down tree. Every transaction has at least one input and at least one output. The simplest and traditionally most common transaction type has one input and two outputs: one describing the actual payment and one describing the change that goes back to the one who initiated the payment. The concept of change is required because Bitcoin doesn't allow an update of the past. It is an append-only log, so instead of going back and modifying past entries, new entries have to be created to reflect any updates. Transactions are what create these updates. For a simple transaction, one new \"entry\" is created to update the balance of the receiver, and one new entry is created to update your own balance. You can think of it as paying for something that costs $5 with a $20 bill. The merchant receives five dollars, and you get $15\u2014the change\u2014back. However, we don't have physical coins and bills, we only have an append-only log. So instead of bills of smaller denominations, new entries\u2014new UTXOs\u2014are created. While this design is ingenious when it comes to validation\u2014you can easily make sure that everything adds up at all times\u2014there are certain nuances to consider when it comes to privacy. For example, if it is trivial to determine which output is a change output and which one isn't, it is trivial to cluster outputs and thus identify not only the flow of funds, but also who transacted with whom, at what times, and\u2014of course\u2014the amounts that were transacted. Imagine a data leak that exposes all transactions of every company, every individual, every politician, every bank, every merchant, every online shop, and every vending machine. When used naively, this data leak is Bitcoin. Luckily, the situation is not as grim as it sounds. Developments and techniques exist to remedy this situation. To understand them, we have to understand the various transaction types that Bitcoin allows. Bitcoin Transaction Types We already discussed the most common transaction type: the \"simple spend.\" There are also transactions that have only one input and one output, transactions that have multiple inputs and one output, and transactions that have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Let's call them \"No Change,\" \"Consolidation,\" and \"Batch,\" respectively. While Bitcoin's transaction graph is public, it is important to point out that any analysis that is applied to this data is heuristic. For example, a user might create a transaction that splits a UTXO in half, resulting in two outputs that belong to the same entity. Or, to pick another example, a regular spend might produce two outputs that are exactly equal, making change detection virtually impossible. Because identification can only happen heuristically, one part of the solution to Bitcoin's privacy conundrum lies in collaboration. Collaborative Transactions When it comes to privacy, collaboration is the norm. Take encryption, for example. If you want to have a secure communications channel with another party, you start a collaborative process. You meet, you exchange secret information, and you use this secret information to encrypt your messages. We call this exchange of secret information a \"handshake,\" and over the last decades, we implemented all kinds of handshakes into our communication and networking protocols to make sure that bad actors can't eavesdrop on our communications. Similarly, cryptographers and security researchers are currently working on protocols and techniques that make sure that bad actors can't eavesdrop on your every financial move. As with end-to-end encryption, these protections are important for all and a matter of life-and-death for some. Dissidents, journalists, whistleblowers, political activists\u2014these are only a few groups of people that depend on secure communications, which includes financial communication. That privacy is important for these groups is an understatement. It is absolutely essential. This is also why the Human Rights Foundation launched a fund to support software developers who are making the Bitcoin network more private, decentralized, and resilient. So, how can we think about a \"handshake\" in the world of bitcoin transactions? It's quite simple, really. As mentioned above, a bitcoin transaction can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. The privacy techniques that are currently being developed are making use of this feature. The interesting part is that not all inputs have to be controlled by the same party. Thus, the \"handshake\" is about bringing multiple parties together to collaborate on a bitcoin transaction. Once the collaborating parties agree on the parameters of the transaction, the transaction is signed by all parties and broadcast to the network. Because of the heuristical nature of transaction analysis, an onlooker won't be able to figure out the flow of funds. One especially promising technique to increase the privacy of all is to combine the above with an actual payment. In this scenario, the \"handshake\" is about bringing a merchant and a customer together to craft a special transaction that can only be deciphered by said merchant or customer. An eavesdropper is left with multiple interpretations of the transaction, each equally likely. Such a transaction is called a \u201c PayJoin .\u201d Even if only a small percentage of transactions are PayJoin transactions, the privacy of all participants in the network is increased substantially. As more wallets and merchants adopt and support these privacy features, we will see a substantial increase in privacy on Bitcoin's base layer. However, as we have seen with the adoption of Transport Layer Security on the Internet, it takes some time for an upgrade of this sort to be implemented and embraced. Transport Layer Security When the internet was a new thing, we didn't think that it would envelop all our communications and all our lives. Encryption was an afterthought. After a while, however, we figured out that having all our communications available in plain text, readable by everyone who had the interest and technical proficiency to do so, wasn't a terribly good idea. Consequently, we made a concerted effort to change things. We upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS and from plain text messages to end-to-end encryption. While this switch isn\u2019t 100% complete yet, encrypted communication became the default over time. This upgrade took a long time, since, similar to Bitcoin, nobody is in charge of the internet.

Best Practices","title":"Transport Layer Security"},{"location":"privacy/02-best-practices/","text":"Best Practices As with every\u00adthing in Bitcoin, taking control of your privacy is a gradual, step-by-step process. Learning about and imple\u00admenting these best practices takes patience and respon\u00adsi\u00adbility, so do not be discour\u00adaged if it seems overwhelming at first. Every step, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction. Take Action The following are action\u00adable steps you can take to increase your privacy: Self-custody your coins Do not reuse addresses Minimize exposure to KYC (Know Your Customer) Minimize exposure to third parties Run your own node Use the Light\u00adning Network for small transactions Do not use public block explorers CoinJoin early and often Self-custody your coins Not your keys, not your bitcoin. If someone else is holding your bitcoin for you, they know every\u00adthing there is to know about these coins: amounts, trans\u00adac\u00adtion histo\u00adries, future trans\u00adac\u00adtions, etc. Taking self-custody of your coins is the first and most essen\u00adtial step. Bitcoin Wallet Guide Do not reuse addresses Reusing addresses destroys the privacy of both the sender and the receiver. It should be avoided at all costs. Address Reuse Minimize exposure to KYC Linking your real-world identity to your bitcoin addresses is a neces\u00adsary evil in most juris\u00addic\u00adtions. While the effec\u00adtive\u00adness of these regula\u00adtions is question\u00adable, the impli\u00adca\u00adtions for regular users are mostly negative as a multi\u00adtude of data leaks have shown. If you choose to use KYC on- or off-ramps, make sure that you under\u00adstand the relation\u00adship between yourself and the service in question. You are trusting this service with your personal data, including the future safety of this data. If you still earn fiat-denom\u00adi\u00adnated income, we recom\u00admend using one bitcoin-only service that allows you to execute automatic recur\u00adring buys on your behalf. Swan Bitcoin is such a service. If you want to skip KYC entirely, have a look at no-KYC only. No KYC Only Minimize exposure to third parties Trusted third parties are security holes. If you can rely on yourself instead of trusted third parties, you should. Trusted Third Parties Are Security Holes Run your own node Not your node, not your rules. Running your own node is essen\u00adtial to use Bitcoin in a private manner. Every inter\u00adac\u00adtion with the Bitcoin network is facil\u00adi\u00adtated by a node. If you are not in control of this node, whatever you are doing is seen by the node you are inter\u00adacting with. This means whoever is in control of the node is able to see what you are doing. The bitcoiner node guide is a great resource to get you started. Bitcoiner Node Guide Use the Light\u00adning Network for small trans\u00adac\u00adtions The off-chain nature of the light\u00adning network increases the trans\u00adac\u00adtional privacy of its users without having to jump through too many hoops. While it is still early, the absolutely reckless days of the light\u00adning network are likely behind us. Using it for small- and medium-sized trans\u00adac\u00adtions can help improve both your privacy as well as your fee footprint. Bitcoiner Lightning Guide Do not use public block explorers Looking up addresses in public block explorers will link those addresses with your IP, which, in turn, can be linked to your real identity. Software packages like Umbrel, Citadel, RaspiBlitz, and BTCPay Server make it easy to run your own block explorer. If you have to use a public block explorer, make sure to mask your IP by connecting to them via Tor , or at least use a VPN. Mempool Instances CoinJoin early and often Because Bitcoin is forever, using trans\u00adac\u00adtional best practices such as collab\u00ado\u00adra\u00adtive CoinJoin trans\u00adac\u00adtions will ensure that your privacy is protected going forward.

You can also do a manual installation . Install as a Package The easiest way to install Jam is to install it as a package. Info Please understand the trade-offs you are making when installing Jam as a package. Make sure to verify the integrity and authenticity of the node software you are running. And, if possible, verify the Jam installation yourself. ...with Umbrel Jam can be installed directly from the Umbrel app store: Open the interface of your Umbrel node (type umbrel.local in your browser) Find \"Jam\" in the Umbrel app store Click install Done! ...with Citadel Jam can be installed directly from the Citadel app store: Open the interface of your Citadel node (type citadel.local in your browser) Find \"Jam\" in the Citadel app store Click install Done! Info If you are asked to enter a username and password after installation, enter \"citadel\" as the username and the password that Citadel provides for you. ...with Raspiblitz You can install Jam via the command line in RaspiBlitz v1.7.2 and up. To install it, exit the Raspiblitz menu and run: patch config.scripts/bonus.joinmarket-webui.sh on To get information on how to connect to Jam run: config.scripts/bonus.joinmarket-webui.sh menu We hope that Jam will be available as a one-click app install with RaspiBlitz v1.8.0 . ...with MyNode Jam can be installed directly from the MyNode Marketplace: Open the interface of your MyNode device (type mynode.local in your browser) Find \"Jam\" in the Markplace (Note: the JoinMarket app must also be installed) Click install Done! Manual Installation There are three ways to set up Jam manually: Run the standalone docker image (easiest) Connect Jam to a local JoinMarket instance Connect Jam to a remote JoinMarket instance All these methods have benefits and drawbacks. One method is easy, but you have less control. Others give you more flexibility, but require several manual steps. Choose the method that works best for you. The rule of thumb is: Always prefer to build and verify the applications locally yourself if you have the necessary technical skills to do so. ...with docker image Using docker is the easiest way to run JoinMarket with Jam. However, a disadvantage is that you have to trust the developers and it is rather difficult to verify the authenticity. Prerequisites: Bitcoin Core docker The official Jam standalone docker image is already bundled with JoinMarket and Tor.
